## 🧑‍💻 Local Development

Install dependencies and start the local dev server:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) to view the site locally.

## 🏗️ Building & Deploying

To build the site for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` folder.

Deployment is automated via GitHub Actions. Every push to `main` triggers a build and deploy to GitHub Pages.

## 🌐 Custom Domain

To use a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file in the `public/` folder with your domain name (e.g., `bhdz.dev`).
