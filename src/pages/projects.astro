              Designed to assist defendants and visitors at the Criminal Justice
              Center in Downtown Houston, this self-service kiosk enhances
              navigation and access to court information.<br /><br />
              The system runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a 7” touchscreen and is
              housed in a custom 49” wooden pedestal for visibility and ease of
              use. The Pi launches a web application in kiosk mode, displaying
              building directories, Misdemeanor/Felony court schedules, and
              real-time defendant docket information from a cloud database.
