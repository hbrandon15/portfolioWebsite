          <p>
            I came to imaging science from two directions at once. As a Computer
            Engineer, I needed to understand light. As a professional
            photographer, I needed to understand signals. Those two paths
            converged into something I didn't expect — a genuine obsession with
            the space where optics, hardware, and software have to agree on what
            reality looks like. For four years I've run a professional
            photography and video production business, managing every stage of
            the color pipeline from RAW capture through final delivery in
            Lightroom and DaVinci Resolve. That work taught me that image
            quality isn't just a technical metric — it's a conversation between
            the sensor, the processing, and the human eye on the other end. At
            NASA, I got to take that instinct into a research environment,
            analyzing Optical Coherence Tomography images to study how
            spaceflight physically changes astronaut vision. Precise,
            high-stakes image analysis where accuracy had real consequences.
            That combination of photographer's eye, engineer's discipline, and
            scientist's approach to measurement is what I bring to image quality
            and ISP work. I'm currently building a from-scratch ISP pipeline in
            Python and NumPy, processing my own RAW files through each stage of
            the imaging chain, because I believe the best way to understand a
            system is to build it yourself..

            <p>
              I hold both a Master of Science and a Bachelor of Science in
              Computer Engineering from the University of Houston-Clear Lake. My
              academic career focused on the intersection of hardware and
              software, providing me with the rigorous mathematical and
              signal-processing foundation required for advanced Image Quality
              Engineering and ISP evaluation.
