          <p>
            I am a Computer Engineer and Software Developer dedicated to the
            intersection of high-performance software and imaging science. I
            bridge the gap between low-level hardware performance and high-level
            software execution, combining the analytical rigor of an engineer
            with the creative 'eye' of a professional photographer. My expertise
            lies in architecting full-stack systems and evaluating sensor
            performance, noise characteristics, and tone mapping to deliver
            technically precise and aesthetically impactful visual experiences.
